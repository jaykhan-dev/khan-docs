I first caught the music bug when I saw a live Rock N' Roll performance.  I must have been about 11 but I remember the day like it was yesterday. 
I didn't know it at the time, but it was a Beatles cover band.  The first song they played was [She Loves You]() and I remember I had goosebumps. 
It was like someone had turned on a lightbulb in a dark room, or the clouds had parted and the sun rays lit up a valley after a thunderous storm.


## Blockchain

[Endeavr](/work/blockchain/endeavr/README.md) is the main project related to music and blockchain that is based around my production work. 

>It is a far better policy to deal with fans directly.  

The simple idea of owning a song with the artist is revolutionary in itself.  Writers can be sure that their creations can be traded in a trustless manner, in other words there is no need for middlemen and third parties who always take a large cut of the profits to line their pockets and leave the artist with peanuts.

## Production

I use Ableton for all my compositions, arrangement, mixing and mastering.  With a Bass Station II, which is a great bass synth, the limitations are 
only in the imagination (or the soundbank).
