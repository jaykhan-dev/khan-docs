# Eternal Blue Sky

A work in progress.  For the past few years I've been producing individual tracks that didn't have much of a connection with each other.  I decided to consolidate
all the music I made into one album.

## NFT 
The NFTs are currently in progress.  They will be minted on the Algorand blockchain.

## Data Analysis

Music just like any other artistic endeavour, can be represented as a set of data.  This include BPM, key, title, artists, writers, producers, musicians, 
equipment used, song length etc.
