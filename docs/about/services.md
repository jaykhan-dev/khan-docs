# Services

In terms of freelance work, I use a couple of platform like Contra and Upwork.

## Contra

Contra is a cool new platform for independents, freelancers and contractors.  They primarily use USDC as the payout means.

### Benefits

1. No commission fees
2. Clients don't need to interact with the blockchain if they don't want to

## UI/UX
### Deliverables
1. Wireframe - made with Figma or Adobe XD
2. Prototype - I prefer to usable prototypes instead of fake ones which is why I use Vue JS to quickly whip up a new website/app.

### Description
UI/UX is broad term that covers alls aspects of interactive design.  Whether it is on the web, mobile, a smart fridge or your car, each software needs to be designed otherwise the user will move on.
