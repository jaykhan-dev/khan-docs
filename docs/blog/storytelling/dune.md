## World Building
[Dune](https://dunenovels.com/) by Frank Herbert.

Frank Herbert created an entire world in Arrakis which feels oddly real.  There is character, substance and a remarkable sense of perspective that gives a reader a lot to think about.  It is philosophical in nature rather than pure technology and science.  The focus on human relationships and evolution on a galactic level is brilliant because it speaks to us on a human level.  Technology may appear to be like magic to those who don't understand it, but it's the interpersonal stories and the characters that drive a story.

My interest in Dune started when I was in my mid 20's.  I was born in the Himalayan mountains, more specifically in the western region called Kashmir.  When I was two years old, my family moved to the middle east, which is a desert.  I saw Bedouin tribes as a child and they facinated me because they were so mysterious.  They are nomads who have survived for centuries in the harsh desert climate.  Their reverence for water, which is sacred in the desert has strong echoes in the Dune series.  I had to learn Arabic in order to read the Quran and visited the Kaaba many times.  I've seen fanatics and heretics alike.  All of this came rushing back into my memories as I sat reading a book written over 40 years ago by an American and it really struck a chord. 

## Ecology
Dune has a very clear message when it comes to ecology.  The planet is being destroyed by outworlders who take and give nothing in return.  This creates an imbalance and skews the natural course of the planet Arrakis.  Greed, corruption, and violence then ensue in order to control the spice melange, the most valuable substance in the universe.  All of this leads to one conclusion, that we must respect the ecology of the planet otherwise we doom ourselves to an early death.  

We are in a situation now where the fate of the entire planet depends on humanity reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.  If we continue to destroy the Earth without any regard to the harm that it is doing, humanity is doomed.  These are scary times and a book like Dune is more relevant now than ever. Frank Herbert saw all this back in the 60's, and now we are at the cusp of a revolution that is waiting to happen. 

## The Hero's Journey
Joseph Campbell wrote about the Hero's Journey most famously in his book [The Hero with a Thousand Faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces).  This book opened my eyes about storytelling.  It felt like I knew this story intrinsically but that's because this 'monomyth' has been retold countless times since the dawn of civilization.  It speaks to us on a deeper level and is a profound source of wisdom.  Watch any hero movie, or read an epic story where the main character must go through a transformation and you will recognize the Hero's Journey.

In Dune, Paul's journey has all the bearings of the hero that we are so familiar with but in a strange setting.  That is genius of Frank Herbert, which is to tell a story that feels both alien and familiar at the same time.  Paul deals with fear and self-doubt as he experiences a series of challenges.  The first half of the book takes him into the desert where he meets the fabled Fremen to learn their ways and fullfill his destiny.

## The Litany

> I must not fear.
>
> Fear is the mind-killer.
>
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
>
> I will face my fear.
>
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me
>
> And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
>
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

## Gom Jabbar
In the beginning of the book, Paul had to undergo a specific test with the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit. In a nutshell, it is a test to see if he can control his impulses under intense pain.  He does this by being forced to put his hand in a box at 'needle point', or the Gob Jabbar.  Failure would mean death, but on the other side of pain, is transformation.
