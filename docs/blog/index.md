# Blog

Here I write about topics that interest me and they are mostly tech and art related.  It has been a lifelong passion to merge the two.  Blockchain is the best combination because it makes digital ownership much easier to establish. 

### Blockchain

After exploring the alt-coin scene for about a year, I realized that the utility, philosophy and purpose seem scant and illusory.  I see Bitcoin is the main digital asset to focus on because frankly, it started this whole industry and it is by far the largest, more secure and reliable blockchain going.  Being permissionless, open source, decentralized, and public knowledge, it can't be denied that Bitcoin has the best chance of being the world reserve currency. 

### Development

Python and JavaScript are the two languages that I enjoy writing.  I didn't like JavaScript at first because the syntax seemed clunky and verbose, but after learning how to write Python, things started to make sense. I eventually started learning Vue JS and that made developing user interfaces fun and intuitive.  

### Philosohpy

Reading spiritual and philosophical books has helped me understand the world around me a bit better.  I believe the best way to learn is to jump right in and make sense of the way of life as you go.  The book closest to my heart is the Tao Te Ching, then The Art of War.  By expressing complex ideas in simple language, they have stood the test of time and continue to inspire me today.
