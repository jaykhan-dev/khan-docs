# The Art of War
The study of martial arts is in my opinion one of the most crucial one can undertake.  It is applicable to all walks of life and can benefit anyone who takes the time to learn it.  Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to be enrolled in the army to study it.  I lament the fact that martial arts is not taught in schools along with language, mathematics, and science classes.  I would go so far as to say that education has largely failed us because of this omission. 

There are many famous martial artists in 

## Eastern
In the East, there are a few individual that can be said to be masters of the Art of War.  They stand above others either because of their strategic skills and/or cultural dessimination.

### Sun Tzu
[Wiki]()
The author of [The Art of War]() lived over 2000 years ago during the [Warring States]() period.  His little book has influenced virtually all of Asian martial arts and for good reason.  When I first came across the book, I was in my early 20's and it changed my life over night.  No other book has had such a profound effect on me as this one. 

Sun Tzy did not advocate for war.  He preferred resolving conflict through duplicity and deception rather than straight up fighting.  He advised gathering intelligence and using spies to create discord.  There is a strong underlying Taoist mentality in his work.  The use of paradox can be off-putting or confusing for western audiences, but for me it made perfect sense, and not in an intellectual way but rather in my gut feeling.  

His book is a powerful.  It will help you if you heed its advice and this has been true for many generals in history who have turned to his book for guidance.  It certainly helped me deal with conflict and broke down the rather rediculous idea of fighting being honorable.  There is no honor in fighting, only in winning.  

### Genghis Khan
The greatest military mind in history.  The Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous empire that ever existed and it is a facinating story of how an illiterate nomad united all the warring steppe tribes and virtually dominated most of Eurasia.  Genghis Khan certainly has a fearsome reputation, one that he cultivated in order to get his enemies to surrender rather than fight.  He was ruthless, cunning, and revolutionary when it came to warfare.  

What facinates me is how an army of roughly 100,000 cavalry destroyed almost every army that it faced.  The Mongols suffered very little defeat under Genghis Khan.  He used a radical new system of dividing his army by decimals and scattering any acquired enemy soldiers amongst the different groups so that they could not unite against him. 

By controlling the Silk Road, Genghis Khan had access to unlimited wealth which he did not hoard.  If he was so successful it's most likely because of his novel practice of granting religious freedom and promoting talented individuals based on merit.  

With that being said, there is no doubt that many people perished as a result of the Mongol conquests.  This blog does not aim to rehabilitate him as a feminist or environmentalist though he did rely on women to manage his empire and there is even a report that the conquests wiped thousands of tonnes of CO2 out of the atmostphere.  Genghis Khan by all means was a practical man and what he cared about most was Mongolia.  The rest of the world saw him and his people as barbarians with no redeeming qualities.  Ultimately, his vision fell apart because his decendants became too comfortable and they began to fight each other, which is the single biggest reason the Mongol Empire fell apart. 

### Bruce Lee
A cultural icon who created his own style and made martial arts popular across the world. His influence is immense and when anyone thinks of a martial artist, Bruce Lee is probably the first name that comes to mind.  He initially studied Wing Chun, a popular martial arts style that was developed centuries ago by a woman, [Wing Chun]().  The style is simple, direct and fast.  There is very little showboating, and that's what makes it deadly.
