Stoicism is an ancient greek philosophy which advocates living a life of virtue, free from turmoil, pain and anger.  Acceptance of what we cannot control, focusing on the quality of our thoughts and being calm in the midst of chaos are the basic tenets of stoicism.  

The power of this way of living can help us in our tumultuous times, where the anxiety of climate change, political conflicts which threaten to ungulf us all, and the economic instability can wreck havoc on our minds. If we see life for what it is, and find the proper perspective than living would not be such a chore, and despair would not factor into our daily life. 

## Perspective
My current situation of being jobless and without an income has led me to search for perspective.  I no longer see every rejection as a reflection on my skills or lack thereof. The system is broken.  Accepting that has helped me find perspective and not fall into pits of despair as time slowly creeps by.  Focusing on what I *can* control is my sole responsibility.  This includes learning and enhancing my skills on my own.  I do not wish to waste time and money going to a school system which is more about money than knowledge.  With the ubiqutous reach of the internet, all knowledge is easir to access than ever before.
