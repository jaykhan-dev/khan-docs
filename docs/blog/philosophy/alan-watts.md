>What keeps us from happiness is our inability to fully inhabit the present

Alan Watts has been a great source of wisdom and humour.  There's something in the way he speaks that sounds comforting.  He manages to express complex topics in a simple manner that makes the act of thinking rather bland.  It's about experiencing life.

*I have to remind myself every once in a while to enjoy what I do.*  

### **This is the problem.**  

Matters of finances, taxes, bills, and rent keep pushing their way to the front of my mind when all I want to do is just make music, write a bunch of interesting stories and be creative.  I have skills and I find the process of chasing after a job, a person, or recognition has corrupted the whole endeavour.  

## On music

Music as a way of life is not some hippie notion about peace and love to me.  To experience life in the same way that you might listen to music, is to understand the way nature works.  It comes, does what it has to do, and disappears.  It's like it never existed at all even though we may remember bits and pieces of it.  That remembrance, or writing music down is **not** music.  There has to be sound. 

>So then, in music, though, one doesn’t make the end of the composition, the point of the composition. If that was so the best conductors would be those who play fastest, and there would be composers who wrote only finales! People would go to concerts just to hear one crashing chord, because that’s the end!

## On Death

The ultimate question:

>It’s one of the great wonders of life: What will it be like to go to sleep and never wake up?



## On the Ego

>The biggest ego trip is getting rid of your ego, and of course the joke of it all is that your ego does not exist.

## On the journey of life

>We thought of life by analogy, with a journey, with a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end; and the thing was to get to that end, success or maybe heaven after you’re dead. But, we missed the point the whole way along, it was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.
