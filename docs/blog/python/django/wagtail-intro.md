### Wagtail
[Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/) is a CMS based on Django. It has a modern approach in that it comes with an API so that frontend developers can consume the data with a JavaScript framework, making it headless in a sense.  It has a killer feature called **Streamfields** which is similar to the WordPress Gutenberg blocks.

Google, Nasa, Twilio, Oxfam, JPL, and NHS are some of the organizations using Wagtail making it a good choice for content management. I used it to create a portfolio site and basically learnt about programming by following the tutorial.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Django and backend programming.  There is a learning curve but I found it intuitive and enjoyable to use.
