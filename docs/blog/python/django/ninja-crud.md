### Django Ninja
[Ninja](https://django-ninja.rest-framework.com/) is a way of creating API's with Django.  It is similar to [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) which it is mostly based on.  The great thing about Ninja is the Open API docs that make interacting with API's much more intuitive and easier.
