# Python
[Python]() is a general purpose programming language created by [Guido Van Rossum]() in the early 90's.  The syntax and code formatting makes it a great beginner language for new programmers.  It does get some flack for being a slow language but in my experience the speed issue for what I'm trying to do is negligible. It's one of the most [popular]() languages in the world

Characteristics:

- Dynamically typed 
- Tab indendentation is necessary for the code to function properly
- Supports both functional and object oriented programming paradigms
- Includes garbage collection
- Interpreted, high level language

## PEP
[PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000/) is the Python Enhancement Proposals managed by the community who love the language. By adding enhancements, the language is updated every so often and new versions are released to the public.  Since the project is open source, anyone can be a part of the community. 

### The Zen of Python
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
