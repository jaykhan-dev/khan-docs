# E-Commerce
During the pandemic, many businesses must have realized the importance of e-commerce.  There is no better alternative to brick and mortar stores than an online store which is always open.  In the early 2000s, the rise of WordPress paved the way for how content creators and managers built a web business.  Being monolithic by design,  it worked well for a while until it didn't. 

## Headless CMS
The rise of WordPress showed the world that what people really want is a way of managing data.  Not everyone is going to learn how to write PHP, Java, or Python, but those that do have an advantage when it comes to building their own systems or using existing ones and making the most out of it. 

A modern e-commerce system can be characterized as follows:

- Separate backend, usually a Relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Separate frontend made with JavaScript frameworks like Vue JS, React
- REST API that outputs JSON
- Decoupled CMS that the admin and managers interact with to manage their content

## Benefits
The benefits to this approach are numerous but here are a few points to consider

- There is more flexibility in the infrastructure
- Modular approach makes it easier to add new services
- Decoupled architecture is more robust, meaning the whole system won't come crashing down if one thing fails (unlike monoliths)
- The headless approach is easier to scale because a developer can pick the best of breed tools rather than be locked into a specific system

## API
The layer that glues everything together.  It is common practice today to utilize different frameworks and technologies rather than use a monolith software stack. 

## Ecosystem
The software world is a giant ecosystem.  My preference is Vue JS because it is easier to learn and still quite powerful.  The biggest reason however, is that it's built by the people rather than a major corporation like Google or Facebook.  Decentralization is coming, and I believe that centralized systems will need to adapt accordingly. Why?  People are starting to realize that they never really had much control of their online identity and data.  This has created much bad blood with users and the platforms that claim to serve them.

### JavaScript
Along with HTML/CSS, JavaScript is essential to creating interactive experiences on the web.  The proliferation of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue have made developing a user interface easier (in some sense) and most importantly, more modular.  It is easy to write separate components that you can then just plug and play.
