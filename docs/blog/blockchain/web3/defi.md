# DeFi
Decentralized Finance is the future of finance.  Ever since Bitcoin came onto the scene as an antidote to the central banks, the financial world has seen some seismic changes in how money is used. In contrast to the banks, anyone can create an account in the crypto-verse as long as they have access to the internet.  Even banks themselves are adopting the technology (at least the smart ones) because they fear losing out on a rapidly growing market.

## Canada
The protest in Ottawa by the freedom truckers highlighted a key issue that will become more front and center as more people realize the over-reaching power of the federal government in being able to freeze our assets. 

I am personally not anti-vax and feel that the protest was largely misguided in its attempt to demand the COVID restrictions be reduced.  It was going to happen anyway but they decided to make a bad situation even worse, by hurting local businesses in the downtown core which didn't do them any favours.  

I understand that the COVID pandemic has created a lot of tension financially for many families who rely on travel and cross-border trade.  What ended up happening is that the Trudeau government initiated a state of Emergency that was unprecedented and basically forced the protestors out and attacked their supply lines and financial reserves.

Some protesters used Bitcoin to bypass their assets getting frozen.  This is important because it means that the system works and the government can't stop these transactions (as long as it is P2P) whereas centralized exchanges like Binance can be made to freeze accounts.  There is a saying in crypto:

>Not your keys not your coins

The keys refer to the [seed phrase]() and [private keys]() of your wallet account. 

This episode in Canadian politics has shown the world that we need DeFi more than ever.  I plan on switching over to a decentralized system completely in the next few years.
