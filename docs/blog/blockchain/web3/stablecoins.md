Stablecoins are digital currencies similar to crypto but tied to a reserve asset like Gold or USD.  This is beneficial to businesses who want a cheaper way to make transactions without a central bank and deal with their fees and legacy technology.  Secure by design, a stablecoin has value in the real world and the utility is less risky.

## USDC blogs and resources
USDC seems like it will be a big player in the stablecoin scene.  Pegged to the US Dollar means that it has a near universal value since the US economy is the biggest in the world. Being able to pay for goods and services through USDC will most certainly make cross-border finance easier in many ways.  The near instant finality of the Algorand blockchain with minimal fees is a very attractive venture.

## Canada
Since I'm based in Canada, QCAD and VCAD are the two stablecoins that I am watching.  It will be interesting to see how it takes off.  Mainly what I'm looking for is to switch over all my $CAD to a stablecoin so I can avoid the monthly bank fees.
