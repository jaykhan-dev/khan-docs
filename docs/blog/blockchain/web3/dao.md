# DAO

## What is it?
[Decentralized Autonomous Organization]() is a new organizational structure that was not possible until the blockchain came along. Essentially, there is no leader, no HQ, and no traditional hierarchy.  This may sound alarming because we are so used to leaders and a DAO seems to be anarchistic.  I believe wholeheartedly that there must be a balance of the opposing forces.  One cannot exist without the other.  In every society there are aspects that appear positive and those that appear negative.  We may call it simple Good Vs Evil, but that viewpoint is lacking in nuance.  

A large part of a DAO is to use smart contracts to facilitate trust.  Since no third party is required, voting, or a census of the participants is conducted through code. Tokens are either purchased or airdropped to all those interested and this gives them a 'stake' in the voting. Remember that behind all this technology there are regular people who are writing the code and creating a system that benefits all those involved.  

## The Anarchist
[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism)

By definition an anarchist rejects traditional hierarchy.  Leadership is a complicated enterprise because morality rarely plays a part as [Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli) so aptly pointed out in his controversial treatise, [The Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince).  It is natural that there will always exist a portion of the population who see themselves as outside the norm.  This is certainly nothing new, in fact one my favourite books, [Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching) is very anarchistic in nature which is a stark contrast to Confucian conservatism.  

I believe that leaders ultimately do more harm than good.  However, our established institutions are not going to just disappear because we have a new technology.  In fact, those in power will most likely double-down rather than give an inch.  With that being said, the best course of action is to *work around the traditional system.*

## Why is it important?

By leveraging blockchain technology, a new organization built on the principles of a DAO can be more effective.  If you have ever worked in a large corporation, you might feel that process is very slow because there are layers of approvals needed and that can take weeks.  Why?  Who knows.  It's frustrating and frankly a waste of time.  Being clumsy but quick is better than over-thinking and missing the opportunity.  Once missed you rarely get another one.

With a DAO, the possibilites open up immensely and pretty much anyone can particiapte.  I've spent a long time applying to jobs to corporations and just getting your foot in the door is like pulling teeth.  It takes skills, communication and a bit of luck.  With a DAO, it's about passion. 

## Comparison

The following comparison is taken from the [Ethereum website](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/):

| DAO | Traditional |
| --- | --- |
| Usually flat, and fully democratized.| Usually hierarchical. |
| Voting required by members for any changes to be implemented. | Depending on structure, changes can be demanded from a sole party, or voting may be offered. |
| Votes tallied, and outcome implemented automatically without trusted intermediary. | If voting allowed, votes are tallied internally, and outcome of voting must be handled manually. |
| Services offered are handled automatically in a decentralized manner (for example distribution of philanthropic funds). | Requires human handling, or centrally controlled automation, prone to manipulation. |
| All activity is transparent and fully public. | Activity is typically private, and limited to the public. |
