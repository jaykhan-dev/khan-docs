# The Software Industry
The following 4 points are the result of years of research in how the software industry is evolving, by first looking at what is happening and then finding patterns. 

## Modular
The modular approach is a plug and play system.  It allows for better collaboration and more versatility and flexibility.  A developer or entrepeneur can pick and choose what techology they want to use rather than work around the monolithic culture of 'take it or leave it'. 

The following list is a general view on what is involved with the decoupled approach:

- Headless CMS
- Microservices
- APIs 

Large corporations such as Amazon, Netflix, and Uber have paved the way with their adoption of this approach and they are some of the biggest internet companies in the world.  Small businesses are the only ones where the decoupled architecture may be more expensive if they don't have development skills or can't afford a developer.  

## Remote
The COVID pandemic brought to light a problem that many workers were feeling but didn't have leverage to voice.  That is remote work is preferable to working in an office.  When gas prices are sky-high, and inflation is decimating the value of the dollar, people are frustrated and are voicing their complaints.  

For me this is not surprising at all.  Remote work is better because it saves time and money and those who are committed to producing great work can now enjoy their work rather than be forced into a cubicle staring at a screen all day.  The option to listen to your own music, wear whatever clothes you want and still work is an opportunity that can't be ignored. 

I believe wholeheartedly that business will need to adjust to the changing times or risk driving their business into the ground (unless you're an oil company).  The signs are clear and the people will rise to the challenge if you give them a healthy work/life balance.

## Blockchain
A new techology that has seen enourmous gains in the past decade.  It is virtually impossible to ignore the blockchain because of how disruptive it is.  By changing the very nature of how we conduct financial transactions, the industry is starting to see the cracks in traditional finance.  

In my opinion, the old way was forced on us and we had to just use their system or be shut out of important services, both public and private.  I see how centralized systems may be weary of the blockchain but they risk being left in the dust if they don't adapt, and quickly. 

## Sustainable
We need a planet to live on.  We need some sense of stability to function.  Without this planet, there is no business.  As far as I have read on this topic, humans have undeniably changed the atmosphere with our carbon footprint.  We are basically in damage control mode now.  But there are smart scientists who are working on solutions and we must adapt quickly.  

The most obvious changes we can make are remote work and not use traditional financial systems that support polluting industries like the Oil and Gas.  Now I understand that oil is a fundamental part of the industrial age, but it is hurting us and if we don't act, we are certainly not doing ourselves any favours.
