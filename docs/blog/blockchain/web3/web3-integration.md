# Web3 Integration

## Intro
This document highlights the benefits of using blockchain for small to medium sized businesses in order to stay competitive. By utilizing blockchain I believe entrepeneurs and startups can gain an edge over traditional businesses who stick with legacy systems.

## Pain Points for E-commerce

- Transaction processing fees
- Security risks of selling online
- Fraud when it comes to credit cards
- Supply chain issues like not knowing where an item came from

## How blockchain can help

### Trust
Smart contracts leverage code and mathematics to certify a transaction rather than middlemen.  This reduces the risk of fraud and gurantees integrity.

### Cost
Fees associated with Bitcoin are less than those of traditional monetary systems. However, blockchains built on Ethereum have high gas fees and should be taken into consideration when conducting transactions.  

### Supply chain
Blockchain technology can track where goods come from. This helps determine if a product is authentic or not.

### Security
Blockchains are encrypted by design, which means tampering with the data or trying to hack it is virtually impossible. 

### Speed
Since crypto payments are direct transactions from customer to seller, any delay is more of a matter of seconds and minutes rather than days.

### Rewards and branding
Offering rewards in terms of crypto are a great incentive for small businesses to adopt blockchain technology.  This would be great for PR, marketing purposes and a way to attract both new and repeat customers. Happy customers make for good sales people. 

### Wider customer base
Money transfers and payments can be sent to anyone around the world (provided they have a crypto wallet) without the need for exchanging currencies and bank transfer fees.

## Non Fungile Tokens
NFTs have gained a lot of momentum over the past few years. It helps solve a critical problem with authenticity and helps businesses create a trusted and loyal following.  

### Supply Chain
In the food industry, it is difficult to trace where an item came form and what is in it. With blockchain, an item can be tagged with a unique identifier such as an NFT, which can then be tracked easily and cannot be tampered with. 

### Artwork
NFTs track the originality of a specific artwork thus eliminating counterfeit work in circulation.  This has been a major concern for writers, artists, musicians who must spend a lot of time, energy and resources in keeping their work from being stolen.  

## Stablecoins
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a reserve asset like Gold or the US Dollar. This ensures stability and in terms of market price whereas cryptocurrencies are known to be volatile. Being unattached to central banks, stablecoins are like a bridge between the crypto and fiat currencies. 

### Benefits

- Simplify the process of money transfer on exchanges for cryptocurrencies
- Faster transfer speeds
- Available 24/7 whereas banks close on holidays and weekends
- Lower fees as compared to fiat currencies
- Borderless economy
- Programmable (with smart contracts for specific use cases)
- Transparent (all blockchains are pubic knowledge)
- Can become a real currency
- For investors in countries where the local currencies can depreciate in value, stablecoins provide an alternative solution to storing value

The two biggest stablecoins are tied to the US Dollar.

## Blockchain solutions

### Bitcoin
[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) introduced the blockchain to the world.  This radical new technology has disrupted entire industries and has come a long way in a relatively short amount of time since its inception in 2009.

[Lightning network](https://lightning.network/) was built to scale Bitcoin and make payments faster. Since it is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, it takes advantage of the inherent security of Bitcoin while also allowing for programmability.  

### Algorand
[Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/) is one of the best blockchains to emerge in the past few years and is gaining traction quickly.  Lately they partnered with [FIFA](https://www.fifa.com/) to bring crypto payments to the World Cup, the biggest sporting event in the world.  This will onboard many more users to the blockchain technology.  

### Benefits
- Low blockchain transaction fee (only 0.001 Algo)
- 1000 transactions per second (soon up to 46k per second)
- Block finalisation in less than 4.5 seconds (soon to be 2.5 seconds)
- Supports stablecoins like USDc and USDt

### Polygon
[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is an Ethereum scaling platform.  The purpose of this project is to lower the barrier of entry to web3 and Ethereum specifically.  A major concern with Ethereum at the moment are the high gas fees and slow transaction speeds.  Polygon aims to fix these issues by using the Proof-of-Stake protocol which is significantly different than the original Proof-of-Work protocol that started with Bitcoin.

Polygon has their own token called Matic.
