# Crypto Jobs
The Crypto job market has taken off big time.  Blockchain seems to be the hottest industry now and this is clearly evident because of how it keeps popping up in the news and political discourse.  The industry is only going to grow more because even banks are starting to adopt the techonology.  

It is also important to point out that there are a lot of conflicting viewpoints about what is the best blockchain.  Bitcoin maximalists say PoW is more decentralized whereas PoS say it is better because it's cheaper and faster.  

In my opinion, Bitcoin has played it's part and just needs to keep its head above the water to survive the tsunami of legislation and anti-blockchain sentiment.  The baton has been passed down to the children of Bitcoin and we must carry the banner of freedom and decentralization to its logical conclusion.

This page is about getting into the industry, by any means necessary.  Learn the languages, or create designs that show an understanding of what blockchain is and how it can help people.

### Forging Alliances

It is important to build a network because it is crucial for success.  Real people.  Technology is just a means to an end.  

- Linkedin messages
- Discord Servers for projects
- Reddit crypto users

## Failures

- Traditional jobs are slow to respond and I've been ghosted/rejected even when I thought the interview went well. 
- Random recuiters reaching out who sound fishy and ask for too much information like the last 4 digits of a SIN card. 
- International interviews didn't work out due to time differences.
