## Song That Owns Itself

[Official Site](https://stoi.org)

I recently came across this **awesome** project.  Ideas like these are exciting because they are using cutting edge technology like the Algorand Blockchain to help
artists be more self-sustaining. As far as I'm concerned, this is the way forward and why I love Algorand.  

The music industry will adjust to this new development.  Antiquated ways of dishing royalties and rights are starting to feel the heat.  It makes more sense to share your art directly with your fans because the best marketing is P2P. 

## What is it?

Based on their whitepaper: 
>The Song That Owns Itself reimagines artistic ownership for the digital age and redefines value based on individual experience.

From my understanding, STOI is a new way of owning music. Based on [smart contracts](https://) that automatically distributes earnings to all stakeholders.  In order to receive awards, you must own tokens of the song which can be obtained from the STOI website once you connect your [Pera Wallet](https://perawallet.app/).  

Airdrops are a neat way to spreading the word directly to the customer.  No marketing agency, or label has the control to distribute songs and get it heard.  By owning tokens, the fan is participating directly in the blockchain system that benefits them by promoting the song.  

>Art wants first to be seen and heard, and second, to be appreciated

STOI lists their goals for this project in their Whitepaper:

- I. Empower more artists to create sustainable careers on their own
terms
- II. Increase the total addressable market for all current participants
- III. Increase the rate of entrepreneurial innovation
- IV. Expand the market for music into heretofore adjacent or orthogonal
realms
- V. Enable consumers to play a more active role in the awareness
building of works that move them
- VI. Create fast, transparent payment tools

The value of music has been eroded over time with the proliferation of MP3s because of how easy it is to reproduce the same song.  Whereas during the Beatles era, one had to buy a physical copy of a record and have a record player, that is no longer the case except for die-hard fans, and collectors.  Nowadays streaming is the main method of listening and discovering music.  With this radical new approach to music owernship, the tides have turned and this is only the beginning!

## DMC
DMC is a legendary rapper from the pioneering hip-hop group [Run-DMC](http://www.rundmc.com/).  He recently created a song called [Million Scars](https://stoi.org/s/3) which runs on a smart contract on Algorand.  

What makes this revolutionary is that fans can own a part of the song in tokens.  This means that if the song does well and earn money, so do the token holders.  In other words, it's in my best interest to promote the song. 

From DMC:

>For years companies have been trying to get me to do something on blockchain. I have been hesitant because so much of it seemed about speculation, and I was worried about the environmental impact. I didn't want to be another celebrity putting out NFTs or whatever just because it's the hot thing to do and people are giving me money to do it. Then George Howard (arts advisor to Algorand and stoi.org founding member) reached out and introduced me to Algorand which has not only proven that blockchain can be carbon neutral, but is also already being used in so many ways that bring real value to the world. Releasing a STOI today is the first step in launching my DMC (Decentralized Media Company) with the larger goal of creating the next iteration of the music industry that values creators, fans and supports them all in the most transparent and fair way possible.
