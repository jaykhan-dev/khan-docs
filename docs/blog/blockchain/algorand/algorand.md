# Algorand

## Offical website 
[Algorand](https://algorand.com)

## About
Algorand is a **third generation blockchain** that is fast, secure, decentralized, and has low gas fees which means it's easier to participate.  Anyone who holds 1 Algo in their wallet can be a validator to write the new block to the chain.  This fact alone makes Algorand the future of how blockchains will be built because it consumes far less energy and can be scaled to thousands of transactions per second.  

Below I highlight some major points about this revolutionary technology and why the web3 is an exciting time to be an investor, creator and developer. 

## Silvio Micali
A major player in the cryptography field, Silvio is a Turing Award winner (in computer science), of the Gödel Prize (in theoretical computer science) and the RSA prize (in cryptography).

>Silvio Micali has been on the faculty at MIT, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, since 1983. Silvio’s research interests are cryptography, zero knowledge, pseudorandom generation, secure protocols, and mechanism design and blockchain. In particular, Silvio is the co-inventor of probabilistic encryption, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Verifiable Random Functions and many of the protocols that are the foundations of modern cryptography.

## Pure Proof of Stake

>Algorand uses cryptographic sortition to select users to propose blocks for a given round. When a block is proposed to the blockchain, a committee of voters is selected to vote on the block proposal. If a super majority of the votes are from honest participants, the block can be certified.

## NFTs
Non fungible tokens are all the rage right now.  There is some controversy regarding their utility but it seems that there is an enduring value.  Personally, I plan on creating NFTs for my music and chose Algorand specifically after much research. NFTs are also known as [ASA's](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/) and they can be made easily.  

>NFTs: a unique digital asset with on-chain representation of ownership and identification of its authenticity that include assets where the value is embedded in the data of the NFT, external to the NFT (in-game items), or with an off chain asset (real estate or IP rights).

## Ecosystem
The ecosystem seems to be growing everyday.  There are many companies actively building on Algorand and because of the many SDK's for popular programming languages, it makes development easier to pickup and learn.

Below are some of the ones that I've been using a lot.

### Exploring the blockchain

## Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are code that run on the Algorand blockchain.  These contracts basically replace the traditional way of conducting business by eliminating the need for a third party.  The complexity involved depends on what and how something is being traded between the two principal participants. My interest is mainly in the music realm because regular artists like myself need a way to sell our music and make money from it directly rather than going through loops and paying lots of people for a minor role.  This would allow artists to be more self-sustaining.  

### [AVM](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/)
>This virtual machine contains a stack engine that evaluates smart contracts and smart signatures against the transactions they're called with. These programs either fail and reject the transaction or succeed and apply changes according to the logic and contents of the transactions.

### [PyTEAL](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/)
>TEAL is an assembly language syntax for specifying a program that is ultimately converted to AVM bytecode.


## The Green Blockchain
Algorand is the greenest because of its state-of-the-art consensus protocol mentioned above: Pure Proof of Stake.  In essence, there is no need for mining which is major shift in how blockchains function.

From their official [website](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/algorands-leadership-in-blockchain-sustainability)

>In the Algorand network, there is no need for mining, as users can become validators simply by staking their ALGO tokens. In this way, Algorand manages to achieve carbon neutrality
