# Intro to Blockchain

## What is a Blockchain?

A Blockchain is a **distributed digital ledger**.  Individual blocks contain information about a crypto transaction.  These blocks are then added one at a time and they cannot be changed in any way.  In other words, a blockchain is immutable when it comes to the ledger history.  Since the blockchain is public knowledge, anyone can see the transactions since the beginning of the blockchain, also know as the [genesis block](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block)

From the main man, Satoshi: 

>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

## Blockchain Trilema

[Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), one of the founders of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) pointed out that a blockchain can satisfy at most only two of the three categories required to make the perfect blockchain. 

1. Security
2. Scalability
3. Decentralization

While this seems like a compromise, it is also [not necessary](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/silvio-micali-lex-fridman-algorand-and-the-blockchain-trilemma).  Being a designer, I look more for User Experience and aesthetic appeal of a project.  However, understanding how a blockchain works and why it's such a promising technology for creators and regular people, is crucial to building the next generation of applications (or [dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/))

## Proof of Work

Proof of Work is the main consensus protocol used by Bitcoin and Ethereum to add blocks to the ledger.  This is rewarded by the respective cryptocurrencies when the [ASIC mining machines](https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=bitcoin+asic) solve a very hard cryptographic problem. 

[Bitcoin wiki:](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work)

>A proof of work is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Bitcoin uses the Hashcash proof of work system.

### Problems with Proof of Work
The most significant problem is the [energy use](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/).  Though still smaller compared to other industries which use a lot of energy like Oil, it is starting to worry investors about the future of Bitcoin.  Governments in [China](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58678907) have banned Bitcoin outright, while others in the [EU](https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-parliament-committee-votes-against-proof-of-work-ban-supports-alternative-amendment-on-crypto-assets/) considered it, but eventually decided not to.

The problem with energy use may perhaps be a distraction.  There are studies that indicate Bitcoin energy use is not as bad as the reports are making it seem.  Also, the question is, who is making these claims and what do they stand to gain?

## Proof of Stake

Proof of Stake is a different consensus mechanism.  It invovles **staking** your coins in a stake pool so that you can become a validator, which is essentially similar to being a Bitcoin miner.  The key difference is that there is no cryptographic puzzle to solve and so the energy consumption is much smaller.  

Ethereum which is currently using the Proof of Work consensus, is switching over to [Proof of Stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/). It requires 32ETH to be staked in order to become a validator.  Since the current price of ETH is over $3000 USD, it can be quite expensive.

Algorand built their own [Pure Proof of Stake](https://www.algorand.com/technology/pure-proof-of-stake) which randomizes who becomes a validator.  Below is a brief description from their website:

>Algorand uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) protocol built on Byzantine consensus. Each userâ€™s influence on the choice of a new block is proportional to its stake (number of tokens) in the system. Users are randomly and secretly selected to propose blocks and vote on block proposals. All online users have the chance to be selected to propose and vote. The likelihood that a user will be chosen, and the weight of its proposals and votes, are directly proportional to its stake.

## Web3

Web3 is the next evolution of the web.  Technology keeps evolving and it is imperative that we keep up.  This can be overwhelming with the speed at which technology evolves, but to stagnate is akin to running a business into the ground.  

A good example of web3 are the new generation of browsers that have come about as a result of blockchain technology. 

1. [Brave](https://brave.com/)
2. [Decentr](https://decentr.net/)

The above the two that I am familiar and have used over the past year, but there are more and each will have it's own currency probably, with the ability to connect to dapps and signin using crypto wallets.  This is significant because the norm is to create an account with a centralized organization where they can then use your data without your knowledge.  

## Use Cases

Blockchain is disrupting many industries.  In my opinion, legacy systems will incorporate blockchain into their lexicon because the old adage "Follow the money" will always be true.  Once more people see how blockchain benefits them and the utility behind the dapps, they will switch over.  

With every revolution, there is always some resistance and then finally acceptance.  Below are some of the major use cases as outline by [Consensys](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/)
