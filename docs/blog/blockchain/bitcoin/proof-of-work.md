# Proof of Work

## The Bitcoin consensus protocol

The hashcash system of mining bitcoin was first created by a British programmer called Adam Back, who is currently the CEO of Blockstream.  Some people even believe he might be Satoshi Nakamoto because of the British references and diction in his writing.  Nevertheless, the identity is not at question here, but instead how new Bitcoins are created and why Proof of Work is significant.  

## PoW vs PoS

Proof of Stake is radically different from Proof of Work.  Essentially, in a PoS system, all the coins are created in the beginning and are then distributed amongst the original founders first and then sold to the community.  This reduces energy use exponentially and PoS blockchain companies tout how they are environmentally friendly and how fast and cheap their protocol is.  On the surface this looks like a net positive but there is an underlying problem.  It is not truly decentralized.  If an institution, foundation or a group of developers can change the protocol, is that not centralized in essence?  

Proof of Work has been critisized for using lots of energy and how a few mining pools control most of the hash power.  In the case of Bitcoin, it may seem centralized but the miners don't actually control the entire network.  There are different kinds of nodes that have their own purpose.  The miners are important to keep producing new bitcoins, but they don't actually contorl the network with their hashrate.  

There are 3 kinds of nodes:

- Light nodes
- Full nodes
- Mining nodes
