## Graphics and branding

### Concept 1
The idea was to use the exclamation mark with a signal graphic, similar to what you might see on a radar.

### Concept 2
Combining a folded map with the exclamation mark in a triangle, which is universal for an alert.  The group decided to go with this one.

### Icons
Made with Adobe Illustrator.  Each icon represents an incident which could be an enemy sighting (red) or a friendly station (yellow/blue).

## Wireframes
This is a wireframe for a new design. [See prototype](https://conflict-alerts.netlify.app)
It is a work in progress at the moment and the main blocker for release is hooking up the backend data, logic, and responsiveness.

## User Flows
The main purpose of this site is to allow users to upload videos.  In this case, the user must signup first and then use the 'Upload' video link to select a video.  There are certain decisions that need to be made like location and tags.  The tags will determine what icon gets used and the location is necessary to help Ukrainians look up hot spots.
