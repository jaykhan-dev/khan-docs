# Appreci

## Design prototype

[Landing Page](https://appreci.netlify.app)

## My Role
My role was to create a new layout for the landing page to make it more appealing.  I used Vue JS and Tailwind CSS to create a design prototype and hosted it on Netlify for fast loads with HTTPS security.  With a strong background in graphic design, I was able to create the initial design in about 8 hours with scrolling animations and a responsive layout.   

Additionally, I recreated 2 pages on their official WordPress site with Elementor which is a powerful tool but requires a subscription to get all the features.  I changed their product/catalogue page to make it a bit more modern with parallax images.  I found graphics, gifs, icons, and optimized images for the web.
