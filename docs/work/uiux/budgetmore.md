# Budgetmore

![Budgetmore Hero section](/work/uiux/budgetmore/hero-section.png)


## Project Details

A budgeting application

[See Landing page prototype](https://budgetmore.netlify.app)

[See live project - Work in progress](https://budgetmore.com/)

This project is a collaboration with a friend who is developing the backend logic. He is working with the Plaid API, CSV files, C#, and Mudblazor.

The premise of the application is to help regular people with budgeting. This is achieved by importing data from a bank account and uploading it to the application for analysis. The idea is to make it intuitive and easy to look at the data point and find some insight or organization in managing finances.

My role is UI/UX which involves creating wireframes, user flows, and maybe using Vue JS for the frontend but that is still to be decided.

## Wireframes
The landing page is rather simple.  The only interaction is really in the login/signup section.  The footer is an overview of the whole project but since the backend is still being worked on, all the individual pages need copy and a design.

## User Flows

The user flow is about uploading sample data to play around with.  It requires that you signup first and then import the sample data to play around with.

## Backend
The user is taken to the backend which is being written in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and [Mudblazor](https://mudblazor.com/) on the [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) platform from Microsoft. In the screen shot below we change to the **Import** page.

By clicking on the 'Import Sample Data' button in purple, we can then use made up data to play around with.

If everything works, there should be a success message in the bottom right corner.

Finally, by switching to the Income page, we can see the sample data.  As you can see, there are more functions and features, but these are currently being worked on by the main developer.
