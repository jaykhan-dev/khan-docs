# Melange Labs

![Melange Labs homepage](/work/blockchain/melange-labs/melangelabs.JPG)

[Prototype](https://melange.pages.dev)

[Github](https://github.com/jaykhan-dev/melange.git)

Melange Labs is an incubator for Lightning Apps.  A user can browse open source projects and ask the project manager to join.  The purpose is to find developers, investors and raise capital.  Bitcoin is being adopted by more companies and businesses.  However, the base layer cannot scale to the required amount of transactions per second which is why the Lightning Network exists.

The project is still under construction.
