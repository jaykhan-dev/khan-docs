## Why Bitcoin?
It is currently the most widely used from of digital currency.  Being the first and greatest crypto asset, I'm betting on Bitcoin rather than the thousands of altcoins which have very little utility beyond its own ecosystem. 

Bitcoin has the largest market cap. It is the most decentralized because of Proof of Work protocol.  


## Categories
The following categories are the ones I am focusing on and I think it covers all the bases, except perhaps the educational programs. Once the site is live, it would be easy to add additional affiliates.

### Exchanges
A very important part of Bitcoin is **buying** it.  The fastest way is usually through exchanges, which also have affiliate programs.

### Apparel
This could potentially be a big part of the business.  People love to show their support for a project or idea by wearing t-shirts, bags, hats, bracelets etc.

### Wallets
There are two types of wallets, hardware (cold) and web/mobile (hot). 

#### Hardware wallets
Storing and saving Bitcoin in hardware wallets is by far the safest way.  I see these becoming more popular and therefore it would be a good idea to promote quality products.

## Design style
I'm aiming for minmalistic and simple design white lots of whitespace.  Since there will be lots of content, it is crucial not to overwhelm the user with too much information.  Getting straight to the point and highlighting the best quality of the Bitcoin blockchain. 

- White, blue, black and green colours
- Black and white images of trees, animals, and abstract art for simplicity and minimalism.
