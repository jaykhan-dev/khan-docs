# Endeavr

![Endeavr Hero](/work/blockchain/sound-endeavr/endeavr-new-bg.png)

## Project details

[See live prototype](https://soundendeavr.netlify.app/)

Endeavr is a music project on the Algorand blockchain that eliminates the need for middlemen.  The music industry is constantly evolving.  Any new technology appears threatening but eventually it becomes the norm.  A great example in recent times is the creation of the MP3 which makes creating exact digital copies easy, cheap and fast.  Companies like Napster got a lot of heat for sharing music without having to pay for it that it got sued and eventually had to change its business model.  

With the blockchain, music owernship is no longer a problem.  Anyone with an internet connection can invest directly with the artist rather than buy a song through a third party vendor.  To be sure, giant corporations like Universal control a large portion of the copyrights and have considerable power over an artists career.  It is possible to bypass shady record deals by focusing on the *creator-borderless-economy.*

### Branding
This is a logo that I designed with Adobe Illustrator.  The inspiration is a pirate ship on the high seas. I had an idea of putting the Algorand logo on the mast but will probably decide on that at a later time.

The following projects that are part of the Algorand ecosystem and which eliminates the need to create a new system from scratch.  The best strategy is to get to the market with new music faster and more efficiently, rather than spend years trying to build the perfect platform.  

- [Dequency](https://dequency.io/)
- [STOI](https://stoi.org/)

- [Opulous](https://www.opulous.org/)

## Features

### Invest
By investing in existing NFTs, artists or regular users and fans can participate and even earn crypto.  This is the new way forward made possible by the blockchain.  Historically, every musical group seems to have had issues with their record label taking the lions share of the profits.  Even with streaming services like Spotify, the royalties paid out are peanuts compared to the billions that the company is making. 

**Giving power back to the people is what it's all about.**

### Collaborate
Creating brand new NFTs as a way of producers and writers to split the royalties, masters, ticket sales, and any other kind of merchandise.  By having full control over the music, there is no need for third parties like corporate labels.  Promotion is down to the artists involved and social media. 

### Vote
Quality Assurance for music is useful if you need feedback before releasing a song.  Using a voting mechanism like [Choice Coin](), a user would connect their wallet to login and then choose a list of songs that have been chosen for quality assurance.  

The NFT creator can specify for how long the voting lasts and maybe even a minimum number of votes.  This would all be handled with smart contracts written in either PyTEAL or Reach.

## Wireframes

### Songbook wireframe
The following wireframe is the Songbook app that is the very heart of the entire blockchain project.  This is where users will create a Songbook of their tracks and collaborate with other writers producers and setup a QA group and tasks that need to be finished in order to complete the project.  Each track can be minted as an NFT through the already existing platforms like [STOI](/blog/blockchain/algorand/STOI.md). 

Once published, it will be displayed on the main webpage for investors to browse and dip their toes in the world of blockchain music. The interesting thing about this is that you don't even need to be a musician to use this.  If you have an analytical mind or you are a patron of the arts and want to help artists, this would be a good way to start a new business that can generate passive income.  

This would work for:

- Writers
- Producers
- Managers
- Entrepeneurs
