# Intro

Blockchain technology is my main interest at the moment and it can be applied to most if not all industries.  I first started learning about blockchain at the beginning of 2021 and have been hooked ever since.  Since then, I have learnt how to code in JavaScript and Python, creating simple web applications, and using REST APIs.  

I see myself as a Bitcoin advocate because the idea is big and it takes education and persistance to understand it.  There is a level of complexity with blockchain, but my goal is to make the user experience as simple as possible.  There are many great applications already out there and every day I'm learning more about this fascinating technology. 

## Pros and cons

I believe blockchain is revolutionary for the following reasons:

- self custody of money earned
- public knowledge
- no trusted third parties required
- borderless economy


However there are some downsides:

- the technology is still young
- volatility 
- derivative projects that appear legit end up being scams
