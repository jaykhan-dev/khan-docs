# Work

## Overview

I have been a designer for over 5 years in various indusries. My focus now is in web design/development. With these skills I am planning on creating applications that are easy to use, enjoyable, and engaging. Most importantly, I create content on my own time and publishing it online is the best way in this day and age.

I have experience in following categories:

- Web Design
- Front-end development
- UI/UX
- Marketing
- Blockchain
- Graphic design
