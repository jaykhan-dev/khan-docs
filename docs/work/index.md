# Work

## Overview

I have been a designer for over 5 years in various indusries.  My focus now is in web design/development and blockchain.  With these skills I am planning on creating applications that are easy to use, enjoyable, and engaging.  Most importantly, I create content on my own time and publishing it online is the best way in this day and age. 

I have experience in following categories:

- UI/UX
- Blockchain
- Graphic design

## Web3

The web is evolving.  A P2P, decentralized internet is being actively developed and more and more people are seeing the value in it.  While the remnats of the web2 era are still going strong, the cracks are starting to appear.  A good example is how the big tech companies control most of the traffic on the web.  Privacy and security are promises but not always a reality.  On the surface, this may not seem like a bad thing but once you dig deeper, it is clear that something needs to change.
