# Graphic Design

I started my career as a graphic designer about 5 years ago.  I realized I have a talent in making visually appealing designs but wanted to evolve and work on my challenging and complex projects which led me to UI/UX and web design.  

I mainly use the Adobe Creative Suite to create designs and find inspiration from the art world, online publications, and print material.  I always seek out creative ways of expression to make the message clear.

I've designed digital assets for clients in the following industries:

- health
- law
- medicine
- restaurants
- accounting
- retail
- education
- finance
