# Overview

![Jay Khan portrait](/about/jaykhan-picture.png)

I am a designer, developer, and a musician.  I advocate for blockchain technology because it makes self sovereignty possible.  

## P2P

A decentralized internet is the next big thing.  It is the brave new world of data ownership where power is not centralized with a few companies.  A P2P system is not a new invention but it is about to become a lot more mainstream than ever.  Blockchain technology is a major component of this vision.  Learning about it has opened my eyes to how my online activities were never private and never in my control.
