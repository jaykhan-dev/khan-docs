# Overview

![Jay Khan portrait](/about/jaykhan-picture.png)

I am a designer, developer, and a musician.  I advocate for blockchain technology because it makes **self sovereignty** possible.  

## Focus

A *decentralized* internet is the next big thing.  It is the brave new world of data ownership where power is not centralized with a few companies.  A P2P system is not a new invention but it is about to become a lot more mainstream than ever before and blockchain technology is a major component of this vision.
